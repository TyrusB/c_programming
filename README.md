# c_programming

Though I primarily work in Ruby and JavaScript with a little Java thrown in, I've been learning C in order to
continue to improve my CS fundamentals. 

Given how important a language C and its derivatives are, to CS in general and of course \*nix OSs, I thought it
would be worth diving more deeply into.
